    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <div class="content">Hi, I'm Kristen. I'm currently a junior in the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program majoring in Computer Science and double minoring in Japanese and Visual Arts. I have a passion for both technology and the arts.<br /><br />This year I attended HackHERS, a women-centric hackathon hosted at Rutgers, where I collaborated with a team to create a mobile game that motivates children and teens to pursue an interest in STEM. Despite having no prior experience in mobile app development, we took the initiative to research and learn the required skills, and succeeded in designing an app that won the Best Beginner Hack Award. I'm always self-driven and eager to learn and, after completing a course in Java, taught myself HTML and CSS this past summer.<br /><br />Beginning this fall, I will also be an executive board member of the Rutgers Creative Writing Club. I co-founded this club with another student after we recognized that many of our peers were interested in a more casual environment for workshopping and discussing their own writing as opposed to submitting to on-campus publications. I developed the website for this club to provide updates on meeting information and writing resources.</div>
